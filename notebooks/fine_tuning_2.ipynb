    "# Fine Tune LLM\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Assume that you built a kickass AI application using a large language model (LLM) like GPT-4 or LLaMA. You showed it to your teammates, your manager, your client. Everyone is happy. You get the go ahead to deploy it to production.\n",
    "\n",
    "After 1 month, your client comes back to you. He is not happy with the cost of running the application. The inference cost is too high. Instead of saving cost, the application is costing more money than before. He wants you to reduce the cost of running the application.\n",
    "You think to yourself, \"Hmm, maybe I can fine-tune a smaller model on my specific use case. That should reduce the inference cost significantly\". You replace the model, test it with some use cases, and the results were satisfactory. Your client is happy again. You get the go ahead to deploy the model to production.\n",
    "\n",
    "After 3 months, your client comes back to you again. This time, he is not happy with the quality of the responses from the model. The model is not able to handle some specific queries related to his domain. He wants you to improve the quality of the responses. You think to yourself, \"Hmm, maybe I can fine-tune the model further on more specific data related to his domain\". You gather more data, fine-tune the model again, test it with some use cases, and the results were satisfactory. Your client is happy again. You get the go ahead to deploy the model to production.\n",
    "\n",
    "Above is an example of how fine-tuning can help improve the performance and reduce the cost of running an AI application. Fine-tuning allows you to adapt a pre-trained model to your specific use case, making it more efficient and effective. In the following sections, we will explore how to fine-tune large language models (LLMs). We will also discuss how to deploy the fine-tuned models using AWS SageMaker.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What exactly is Fine-Tuning?\n",
    "\n",
    "Fine-tuning is the process of taking a pre-trained model and training it further on a specific dataset to adapt it to a particular task or domain. This involves updating the model's weights based on the new data while retaining the knowledge learned during the initial pre-training phase. Fine-tuning can be done using various techniques, such as full model fine-tuning, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) which further includes methods like LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation), and adapter-based fine-tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Comparison with RAG\n",
    "\n",
    "You might be wondering, \"Is fine tuning the only way to adapt LLMs to specific tasks? Is there any other simpler way?\" The answer is yes. Another popular approach is Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). RAG combines pre-trained language models with external knowledge sources, such as databases or document collections, to enhance the model's ability to generate relevant and accurate responses. Instead of fine-tuning the entire model, RAG retrieves relevant information from the external source and incorporates it into the generation process.\n",
    "\n",
    "But here is the minor observation, Although RAG is simpler and preferable in many scenarios, it may not always be sufficient for highly specialized tasks that require deep domain knowledge or specific language patterns. Sometime you might want the model to reply in a specific way that is only possible through fine-tuning. In such cases, fine-tuning becomes necessary to achieve the desired performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ideal approach often involves a combination of both fine-tuning and RAG, where the model is fine-tuned on a smaller, domain-specific dataset while also leveraging external knowledge sources for enhanced performance. This again leads to multiple issues, like need for using and maintaining multiple systems, increased complexity, etc. So, it is always a trade-off between simplicity and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of Fine-Tuning Techniques\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several techniques for fine-tuning large language models, each with its own advantages and disadvantages. Some of the most common techniques include:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Full Model Fine-Tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "Involves updating all the parameters of the pre-trained model. This approach can lead to better performance but requires significant computational resources and large amounts of labeled data.\n",
    "In this case all the weights of the model are updated during training. The disadvantage of this approach is that it is computationally expensive and requires a lot of memory. It can also lead to overfitting if the dataset is small. It can also lead to catastrophic forgetting, where the model forgets the knowledge it learned during pre-training.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)\n",
    "\n",
    "Involves updating only a small subset of the model's parameters, making it more efficient in terms of computation and memory usage. Techniques like LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) fall under this category. PEFT methods are particularly useful when dealing with large models and limited computational resources. They allow for faster training times and reduced memory consumption while still achieving good performance on specific tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "PEFT is futher divided into multiple techniques like LoRA, Adapters, Prefix Tuning, etc. Among these, LoRA has gained significant popularity due to its simplicity and effectiveness. LoRA works by introducing low-rank matrices into the model's architecture, allowing for efficient adaptation without modifying the original weights extensively.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Let's Fine-Tune a Model\n",
    "\n",
    "In this blog, we will focus on PEFT using LoRA due to its efficiency and effectiveness for many use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use Qwen/Qwen1.5-0.5B-Chat model from Qwen series by Alibaba for demonstration purposes. However, the same concepts can be applied to other LLMs like GPT, LLaMA, etc. We will fine-tune it on counsel chat dataset from Huggingface which contains mental health related questions and answers.  \n",
    "Basically we will build a mental health chatbot using fine-tuned Qwen model. Note that this is just for demonstration purposes. In real world, mental health related applications should be built with extreme caution and after consulting domain experts.\n"

         "Me and my girlfriend just broke up. She said she loves me but is not in love anymore. This came out of nowhere. We seemed so happy together. It all started when she went to Missouri to visit her family. The first week she was there she was fine then once she went to this one sister’s house everything changed. That's when she told me she loved me but was not in love with me anymore. I thought maybe it was just because she missed her family and she just wanted to be home because she told me that she could not leave them again. Then she told me to come to her in Missouri. So that's what I did. I quit my job I dropped everything, said goodbye to my family in Florida and drove 15 straight hours to be with her. Once I got there everything was fine again.  She apologized for everything and said she didn't mean any of it then we were good for about a week. Then she went back to saying she didn’t love me anymore and had no feelings for me. The only thing that really gets me and makes me not want to accept this is that now she is pregnant. This wasn’t an accident. We were trying to get pregnant, so all this is hard to accept. I love her so much. I have never been bad to her. I've treated her the best I can. I wanted her to be my wife. I was going to propose to her when she got back. Now I'm losing my family and my mind. I don't know what to do.",

Some people think that they can fix a broken relationship by getting pregnant, and all this does is bring up more problems.You say you never treated her badly, and I believe you. People in a relationship can still be unhappy even when there is no abuse or mistreatment going on. In fact, giving too much of yourself to the relationship and not having a “self” outside of this relationship can be unhealthy. It takes two whole, healthy, happy people who are that way when they are single to come together to make a whole, healthy, happy couple in a relationship. Expecting your partner to meet all your needs or to provide your happiness is not going to work.There are two books that I recommend you buy and read. One is Codependent No More. The other is Can My Relationship Be Saved?Sometimes when you cling and try even harder to hold onto someone, it makes you both miserable. You cannot change her and cannot change her mind. Sometimes the best thing is to let go. If it is meant to be, you will end up back together again. It seems like this is something that she needs to decide since she is the one that keeps doing the leaving. I suggest backing off and letting her go. Maybe she needs time to clear her head and make up her mind. If it is meant to be, she will come back. If not, use this time to work on being a healthy happy you on your own.",
